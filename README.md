# Linear-Regression

The goal of this report is to estimate a regression model used by the TA to generate data and to analyse the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, with a particular focus on the interactions between the G and E variables, in order to investigate the natural development of depression in a representative sample of humans, as examined in the study conducted by Caspi et al. and other researchers [1].
